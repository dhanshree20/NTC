    <p class="description">
      UGWT (Underground Water Tank) and OHWT (Overhead Water Tank) treatments in waterproofing are essential processes to protect water storage tanks from leakage, corrosion, and contamination, ensuring the quality and safety of stored water.UGWT and OHWT treatment in waterproofing are crucial for the safety, longevity, and hygiene of water storage systems, ensuring that they provide clean and uncontaminated water.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        Common Methods: <br/> 1) Cementitious Coatings: Applied to the tankâ€™s interior and exterior surfaces to create a waterproof barrier. <br/> 
        2) Polyurethane and Epoxy Coatings: Used for both waterproofing and providing a protective finish, especially in exposed tanks. <br/> 
        3) Bituminous Membranes: Applied to the outer walls of underground tanks for added protection against external water pressure. <br/>
        4) Polymer-Based Sealants: Injected or applied to cracks or joints to ensure a watertight seal.
